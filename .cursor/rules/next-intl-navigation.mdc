# Next-intl Navigation Functions

When using `Link`, `redirect`, `usePathname`, `useRouter`, `getPathname`, or `permanentRedirect` from `next-intl/navigation`, refer to their custom implementation and export in this project.

These functions are lightweight wrappers around Next.js' navigation APIs that consider the routing configuration.

They are defined in:
[navigation.ts](mdc:apps/codehouse/src/i18n/navigation.ts)
import { Link } from @/src/i18n/navigation
